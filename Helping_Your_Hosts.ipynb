    "**In a post-COVID world, hospitality faces challenges as travel restrictions are imposed and lifted (and then re-imposed).** Travel and tourism came to a crashing halt in 2020 and still face challenges in returning to pre-2020 business levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As restless travelers look to escape the confines of their homes, they expect the same high-quality services and experiences as pre-COVID. Competition within the hospitality industry is stronger than ever, putting more pressure on businesses to keep and grow their customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main performance metric for every company involved in hospitality is guest satisfaction.** If a guest isn't satisfied, they are not likely to return for another visit and may share their experience with others, pushing away potential business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb hosts face the same challenges as traditional hotels in these aggressive and challenging market conditions. In order to maximize their profitability and to distinguish themselves from traditional hotels, **Airbnb needs to know which aspects of a host property are the strongest predictors of whether a guest will give a satisfaction score of 4.8 or higher (out of 5).**\n",
    "\n",
    "With this question in mind, I obtained data about Airbnb host properties from the [Inside Airbnb project](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html#:~:text=Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20District%20of%20Columbia%2C%20United%20States) for the Washington, D.C. area. The dataset includes details about the hosts themselves; property details (bedrooms, bathrooms, property types); and reservation availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once I have the data readied, I will use machine learning modeling techniques to determine my most important features for the region.** Then I will provide my final recommendations on what Airbnb should do to maximize the likelihood of their hosts obtaining a score of 4.8 or greater.\n",

The second- and third-strongest predictors are much more difficult (and unrealistic) for Airbnb and hosts to improve.\n",

In my experience in hotel operations, I would often get much more information from the written reviews, including nuances and specifics that the yes/no or 1-5 ratings miss.\n",
    ">* **Include other regions:** My current dataset focused only on the Washington, D.C. area. Due to different regional factors (social/economic demographics; legal restrictions; etc.), other markets may show other features to be more important than my results. Additionally, I would like to explore international data to compare with the domestic data.\n",
